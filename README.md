# DesignPatterns
Design Patterns with C#


# What are Design Patterns

* Design patterns are solutions to software design problems you find again and again in real-world application development. Patterns are about reusable designs and interactions of objects.
* The 23 Gang of Four (GoF) patterns are generally considered the foundation for all other patterns. They are categorized in three groups: Creational, Structural, and Behavioral.
* You can see 19 of them below

## Creational Patterns

- [Singleton](https://github.com/emrepaksoy/DesignPatterns/tree/master/1.Creational_Patterns/1.Singleton)
- [Factory](https://github.com/emrepaksoy/DesignPatterns/tree/master/1.Creational_Patterns/2.Factory)
- [Factory Method](https://github.com/emrepaksoy/DesignPatterns/tree/master/1.Creational_Patterns/3.Factory_Method)
- [Abstract Factory](https://github.com/emrepaksoy/DesignPatterns/tree/master/1.Creational_Patterns/4.Abstract_Factory)
- [Builder](https://github.com/emrepaksoy/DesignPatterns/tree/master/1.Creational_Patterns/5.Builder)
- [Prototype](https://github.com/emrepaksoy/DesignPatterns/tree/master/1.Creational_Patterns/6.Prototype)

## Structural Patterns
- [Adapter](https://github.com/emrepaksoy/DesignPatterns/tree/master/2.Structural_Patterns/1.Adapter)
- [Composite](https://github.com/emrepaksoy/DesignPatterns/tree/master/2.Structural_Patterns/2.Composite)
- [Bridge](https://github.com/emrepaksoy/DesignPatterns/tree/master/2.Structural_Patterns/3.Bridge)
- [Facade](https://github.com/emrepaksoy/DesignPatterns/tree/master/2.Structural_Patterns/4.Facade)
- [Proxy](https://github.com/emrepaksoy/DesignPatterns/tree/master/2.Structural_Patterns/5.Proxy)
- [Decorator](https://github.com/emrepaksoy/DesignPatterns/tree/master/2.Structural_Patterns/6.Decorator)

## Behavioral Patterns

- [Command](https://github.com/emrepaksoy/DesignPatterns/tree/master/3.Behavioral_Patterns/1.Command)

- [Observer](https://github.com/emrepaksoy/DesignPatterns/tree/master/3.Behavioral_Patterns/3.Observer)
- [Strategy](https://github.com/emrepaksoy/DesignPatterns/tree/master/3.Behavioral_Patterns/4.Strategy)
- [State](https://github.com/emrepaksoy/DesignPatterns/tree/master/3.Behavioral_Patterns/5.State)
- [Template Method](https://github.com/emrepaksoy/DesignPatterns/tree/master/3.Behavioral_Patterns/6.Template_Method)
- [Chain of Responsibility](https://github.com/emrepaksoy/DesignPatterns/tree/master/3.Behavioral_Patterns/7.Chain_of_Resp)
